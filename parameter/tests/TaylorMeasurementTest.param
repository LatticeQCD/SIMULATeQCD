# TaylorMeasurementTest.param
#
# input file for measurement of the derivatives of the partitionfunction with respect to the chemical potential.
#
#      Lattice: Nx Ny Nz Nt
#        Nodes: Number of nodes per direction
#
#      residue: residue for inversions
#        cgMax: max cg steps for multi mass solver
#
#            output_file: The file to put the individual randomvector results into. Each mass gets its own file with the respective mass prefix.
#  collected_output_file: The file to put the accumulated end results into. Each mass gets its own file with the respective mass prefix.
#
#         seed: myseed
#    Gaugefile: Configuration to be read in
#
# num_random_vectors: The number of random vectors in the trace estimation for the operators
#     valence_masses: The masses at which to measure all operators
#       operator_ids: The operator ids to measure.
#                     The ids represent the measured operator directly in the decimal representation.
#                     Each digit represents a term with a derivative of order digit-1.
#                     ID 1 is tr(D^-1), ID 11 is tr((D^-1) (D^-1)), ID 12 is tr((D^-1) (D^-1 dDdmu))
