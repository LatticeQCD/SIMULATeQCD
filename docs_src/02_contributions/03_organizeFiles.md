# How to organize new files


All source and header files are stored in `src/<MeaningfulName>/...`.
For example, `src/base/*` holds source files of all base classes which are needed by most programs, e.g. the `Lattice` class or the `CommunicationBase` class.

If you want to add a new executable, be it an application, a test, a profiler, etc., you should save it as `src/<type_of_application>/main_<exec_name>.cpp`. 
If you have added additional `*.cpp` or header files which are needed by your main, you should save them in a new module folder, e.g. `src/modules/<exec_name>/<meaningfulName>.cpp` and add them to the source files
list in `CMakeLists.txt` (root folder):

```Cmake
# If your `*cpp` files contain device code, you need to specify them with this call
set_SIMULATeQCD_gpu_backend(<path/to/file1.cpp> <path/to/file2.cpp>) 
# With this call you define the name of your executable. 
# You also need to specify all your `*cpp` files
set(SOURCE_FILES_<exec_name> <path/to/file1.cpp> <path/to/file2.cpp>)
add_SIMULATeQCD_executable(<exec_name> src/<type_of_application>/main_<exec_name>.cpp
                           ${SOURCE_FILES_<exec_name>})
# Here you specify the type of application. Available types are:
# "testing", "profiling", "examples", "applications", "tools"
set_SIMULATeQCD_property(<exec_name> PROPERTIES RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY "<type_of_application>")
# Add the `HaloDepth` and precision which you want to use in you application. 
# Available definitions are written in `define.h`.
SIMULATeQCD_target_compile_definitions(<exec_name> PRIVATE <your_compile_definitions>)
# Add your executable to the correct compund. Available types are (similar as before):
# tests, profilers, examples, applications, tools.
add_to_compound_SIMULATeQCD_target(<type_of_application> <exec_name>)
```

Header files should NOT be listed there!
* Example programs are stored in `src/example/*`. Ideally, these programs should be as short as possible and strongly commented.
* Testing programs are stored in `src/testing/*`. These programs should check if everything works properly. Please make sure that your tests return a clear pass/fail message. 

An example configuration is stored in `test_conf/l20t20b06498a_nersc.302500`. It is a $20^4$ lattice with a $\beta=0.638$ and it is written in the NERSC format.



Nice examples on how to write SIMULATeQCD code may be found in 
`src/examples/main_plaquette.cpp`
or 
`src/testing/main_GeneralOperatorTest.cpp`.
