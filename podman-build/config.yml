# nvidia - Builds the source just using CUDA. See https://latticeqcd.github.io/SIMULATeQCD/01_gettingStarted/gettingStarted.html#building-source-with-cuda
# Build the source with HIP for Nvidia Platforms. See https://latticeqcd.github.io/SIMULATeQCD/01_gettingStarted/gettingStarted.html#building-source-with-hip-for-nvidia-platforms-experimental

# TODO - ONLY nvidia IS IMPLEMENTED. AMD IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
PROFILE: nvidia

# This controls the number of threads that the build will spawn. It is used as
# follows, `make -j ${CORES}` If left undefined, it will use all cores available
# on the system.
CORES: 

# USE_GPU_AWARE_MPI boolean option that enables or disables the use of GPU-aware MPI libraries when
# building an MPI-enabled application with CUDA. When USE_GPU_AWARE_MPI is set to ON, CMake will
# attempt to find and link against a GPU-aware MPI library, which is a version of the MPI library
# that is optimized for communication between CPUs and GPUs. This can result in better performance
# when running MPI applications that use CUDA/HIP. See https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-cuda-aware-mpi/
# Options are ON or OFF
USE_GPU_AWARE_MPI: "ON"

# This sets the version of the OS *in the container*. This does not need to match
# the target computer. The primary reason for changing this is to allow the use
# of older verisons of the CUDA toolkit. Older toolkits are only available on
# older operating systems. This can be ignored when using the hip_amd profile.
# You will generally want to leave this at latest. This tells the code to grab
# the latest version available. You can also set it to RHEL's major version number.
# Ex: 7, 8, 9.
RHEL_VERSION: latest

# This is the CUDA version you want to use for the build. See https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
# for a list of versions. If you set it to latest, the code will check that link for the highest
# version and use it.
CUDA_VERSION: latest

# USE_GPU_P2P enables or disables the use of GPU peer-to-peer (P2P) communication when building an
# application with CUDA. Nvidia's proprietary GPU interconnect is called NVLink. GPU P2P communication
# allows for direct data transfer between two GPUs without the need to transfer the data to the host
# system first. This can result in faster data transfer and reduced CPU overhead, especially for
# multi-GPU systems. Options are ON or OFF
USE_GPU_P2P: "ON"

# Enable or disable the use of the HIP programming language for AMD GPUs. Options are ON or OFF
# WARNING: This is not currently defined and does not do anything!
# TODO - THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
USE_HIP_AMD: "OFF"
