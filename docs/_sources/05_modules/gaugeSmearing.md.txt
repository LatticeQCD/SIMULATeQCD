# HISQ smearing

Much of the rhmc in SIMULATeQCD follows the MILC code. For a thorough discussion of this
implementation, look [here](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.82.074501).
Here we just list a few important details.

## General idea behind smearing

Typically the gauge connection between two neighboring sites $x$ and $y$
on the lattice is just a single link $U(x,y)$, which is in some sense the
most local connection imaginable. One can also relax this locality, so that
the gauge connection contains information from a larger region around
$x$ and $y$; for example the connection could depend on a general sum,
including many paths connecting $x$ and $y$. Let's call
this sum $\Sigma(x,y)$. Then the gauge connection could be $V(x,y)$,
where $V$ is chosen by extremizing $\mathrm{tr} V\Sigma^\dagger$. These gauge
connections are called [fat links](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.55.R1133).
Fat links modify particle spectra, since they amount to a change of the lattice
propagator.

## HISQ smearing

Taste breaking can be thought of through _taste exchange_, where
one quark changes its taste by exchanging a virtual gluon with momentum
$p=\pi/a$; a quark with low enough momentum can thereby be pushed into
another corner of the Brillouin zone. This is an effect of our discretization,
so taste breaking vanishes in the continuum limit. A strategy at finite spacing
to reduce this discretization effect is to
modify gluon spectra to suppress these taste-exchange processes. This is the
idea behind HISQ smearing.

HISQ fermions utilize two levels of ASQTAD-like smearing, with a unitarization between them.
You can find information about ASQTAD [here](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.60.054503)
and [here](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.59.074502).
The first-level HISQ link treatment is

$  c_1 = 1/8$

$  c_3 = 1/16$

$  c_5 = 1/64$

$  c_7 = 1/384,$

where $c_1$ is the coefficient for the 1-link, and $c_3$, $c_5$, and $c_7$
are for the 3-link staple, 5-link staple, and 7-link staples, respectively.
The first-level smeared link is then projected
back to U$(3)$ before the application of the second-level smearing.
The second level uses

$  c_1 = 1$

$  c_3 = 1/16$

$  c_5 = 1/64$

$  c_7 = 1/384$

$  c_\text{Lepage} = -1/8$

$  c_\text{Naik} = -1/24+\epsilon/8,$

where $c_\text{Naik}$ and $c_\text{Lepage}$ are the coefficients for the
Naik and Lepage terms.


Let's see how this is carried out in the code. Let the original gaugefields be $U$.
For the first level, we smear $U$ links with various 3-link, 5-link and 7-link paths. MILC calls it $V$
```C++
HisqSmearing<PREC, USE_GPU,HaloDepth> V(gauge_in, gauge_out, redBase);
```
To do this use
```C++
V.hisqSmearing(getLevel1params())
```
Next we project the level 1 smeared links back to U(3). MILC calls it $W$
```C++
HisqSmearing<PREC, USE_GPU,HaloDepth> W(gauge_in, gauge_out, redBase);
```
To do this use
```C++
W.u3Project()
```
Finally we smear again the $W$ links with 3-link, 5-link and 7-link paths. MILC calls it $X$
```C++
HisqSmearing<PREC, USE_GPU,HaloDepth> X(gauge_in, gauge_out, redBase);
```
To do this use
```C++
X.hisqSmearing(getLevel2params())
```


To do the tadpole improvement we use the Naik term in the Dirac operator. For HISQ dslash,
the Naik links are constructed from the unitarized links, i.e. using the $W$ links.
MILC calls it $N$.
To use this we have to call
```C++
HisqSmearing<PREC, USE_GPU,HaloDepth> N(gauge_in, gauge_out, redBase);
 N.naikterm()
```
The smearing classes are implemented in
> hisqSmearing.cpp.
How to construct the smeared links are defined in
```shell
main_hisqSmearing.cpp.
```
